## Why use Golang to program HTTP services?

### Other languages might be more popular and effective:

@ul[squares]

- Python is very easy to write and maintain
- Java is extremely efficient and has a solid knowledge base
- C++ is both robust and efficient
- ASP.NET is as good as Java
- PHP is hugely popular and simple

### Are you sure? In my view ...

@ul[squares]

- Python 2 was extremely inefficient as a multitasking platform
- Java has excellent multitasking, I/O, etc. but uses very rigid coding strucures (Servlets, etc.), very verbose code
- coding C++ is extremely hard 
- ASP.NET is similar to Java and Windows platform oriented
- PHP efficiency is not as good as you might think
